# Why solana
  - **Ethereum** is too slow
  - **Solana** works (current solution)
  - **Sui** is yet to learn
  - **IPFS** too slow

# Cost
  - Use testnet instead of mainnet to avoid transaction fee...
  - Schedule a daily workflow to airdrop 1 SOL when the balance < 1 SOL. 

# TODO
- Support SHA1, store/query a number's SHA1 hash instead of the plain number.
